                        Welcome! My name is Nicole D’Andrea and I’m thrilled that you’re here. I’m a Seasoned Yoga Instructor, Multi-Six-Figure
                        Studio Owner and MINDBODY-Certified Business Consultant. I’m passionate about helping other women in business embrace
                        the strategic aspect of their studios because I know how well building authentic systems, a winning team and a cohesive
                        brand lends itself to the flexible schedule and highly profitable studios we all set out to create in the first place.

                    <p>
                        To date, I’ve spent countless hours immersing myself in our industry’s best practices and the latest market trends. I’ve
                        almost never been without a mentor or coach. I’m particularly interested in the unique intersection between mindfulness
                        and entrepreneurship because they. are. not. mutually exclusive! I want female founders to ditch the shame, doubt, and
                        fear and feel empowered by their businesses. I want them to know exactly how they can use their gifts to build a
                        thriving wellness community that changes lives and generates major profit. It’s all about balance.
