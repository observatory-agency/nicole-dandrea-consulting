                        Welcome! My name is Nicole D’Andrea and I’m thrilled that you’re here. I’m a Seasoned Yoga
                        Instructor, Multi-Six-Figure Studio Owner and MINDBODY-Certified Business Consultant. I’m
                        passionate about helping other women in business embrace the strategic aspect of their studios
                        because I know how well building authentic systems, a winning team and a cohesive brand lends
                        itself to the flexible schedule and highly profitable studios we all set out to create in the
                        first place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve grown from a staff of just five teachers to a team of 13 instructors, two massage
                        therapists, four desk staff members and two managers. I built my 19-mat studio in a
                        highly-competitive, “saturated” market into a six-figure business in less than a year’s time.
                        Our community is thriving. These days, I’m in the studio one or two days a week and I teach
                        because I want to. I get to practice my own yoga and take plenty of time off without worrying
                        about what’s happening at the studio or checking my bank balance. It’s not luck, magic or
                        timing. It’s structure, communication, and balance. I want to share it all with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I love being a yoga business coach and I’ve spent countless hours immersing myself in our
                        industry’s best practices and the latest market trends. I’ve almost never been without a mentor
                        or coach. I’m particularly interested in the unique intersection between mindfulness and
                        entrepreneurship because they. are. not. mutually exclusive! I want female founders to ditch the
                        shame, doubt, and fear and feel empowered by their businesses. I want them to know exactly how
                        they can use their gifts to build a thriving wellness community that changes lives and generates
                        major profit. It’s all about balance.
