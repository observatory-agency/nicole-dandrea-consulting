                Tracey came to me with many years of studio ownership under her belt. Her business had always broken
                even, but she was sick. and. tired. of what she (lovingly) referred to as her “little job.” She was
                ready to finally step into her power and expand into a Leader! Listen to how her seven year old business
                had a 105% sales increase in just 4 months of work together!
